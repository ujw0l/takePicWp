Keep reviewing the plugin so I will know what people are looking for, I'm working on other features like letting user to apply filters to their image and edit them.

Currently, this plugin is only for PC web as most of the browser's javascript engine might not be fast enough to support plugin features. I am still working on other alternatives, currently if 
user try to open with mobile deive, they will get unsupported warning.

= Where can I use this plugin? =

You can use this plugin as widget on sidebar or Footer.

= Why can't i delete user uploaded folders? =

You most probably cannot delete them from admin because of file permission issue, talk to the network administrator of server

No, you have to do it manually by yourself as I don't want your user's memorable moments gone by accidentl clicking a link.
